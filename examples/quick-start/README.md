# Quick Start
This is an application that shows how to configure otter and render a simple template.
This project only has 5 files:
1. A Resource to accept and respond to requests.
2. A JSP to render the response
3. Application Configuration
4. Application Entry Servlet
5. Main method to start the web application.

### A complete example
The [hello world application](/hello-world) has examples of all the features otter offers as well as an approach to test 
the application.
